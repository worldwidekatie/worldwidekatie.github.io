Katie holds a BA in International Relations and Political Science from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, though she’s spent most of her career in survey research including 4 years at Gallup and 3 years at the UNL Bureau of Sociological Research. She’s now expanding on that knowledge base by attending Lambda School for data science.
